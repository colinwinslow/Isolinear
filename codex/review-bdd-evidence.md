# BDD-Evidence Review Pass

Confirms each BDD scenario was **honestly hit** — not just claimed-as-passing.
Run **after a test run** on a feature with BDD scenarios, as part of `/closeout`.

## How to run it (Codex)

Run this **inline** during `/closeout`. Unlike the architecture review, this
pass verifies evidence you just produced, so shared context is fine — you're
checking your own work against the scenarios, not forming an independent
architectural opinion. Read the BDD file, read the evidence file it names, and
walk each scenario.

## What you check

For each scenario in `bdd/<feature>/<slug>-bdd.md`:

1. **Is the scenario present in the evidence file?** Match by scenario name.
2. **Does the evidence include raw outputs, not just summaries?** Actual test
   runner output, actual CLI invocations + observed result, actual file
   contents read back — not "✓ passed."
3. **Does the evidence faithfully represent Given/When/Then?**
   - Given: setup state visible (fixture paths, env vars, input state)
   - When: triggering action visible (exact command, exact input)
   - Then: actual result visible and comparable to expected
4. **Is the top-level pass/fail consistent with the per-scenario evidence?**
   No scenario marked passed where the evidence shows otherwise.
5. **Is a run timestamp present and recent?**

Also flag:

- Scenarios in the BDD missing from the evidence
- Scenarios in the evidence missing from the BDD (drift)
- Evidence that summarizes instead of showing raw output
- Evidence claiming pass when the raw output disagrees

## Inputs to gather

- Path to the BDD file (`bdd/<feature>/<slug>-bdd.md`)
- Path to the evidence file (named in the BDD, typically
  `bdd/<feature>/<slug>-evidence.md`)
- Optionally the paired spec for cross-checking `## Proof requirements`

## Output format

Brief (under 400 words):

```
## Verdict
[OK / CONCERNS / FAILURES]

## Per-scenario findings
- Scenario A "<name>": PASS / FAIL / MISSING — [one-line evidence quote]
- Scenario B "<name>": ...

## Drift / hygiene flags
[Scenarios in BDD missing from evidence; vice versa; summary-instead-of-raw.]

## Recommendations
[Concrete. What to fix in the evidence file or BDD.]
```

## Rules

- Don't rewrite the evidence. Report; let the caller decide.
- Be skeptical: claimed-as-passing without raw output is a CONCERN.
- If the evidence file doesn't exist where the BDD says it should, that's a
  FAILURE — the test infrastructure isn't producing evidence.
- If the BDD has only stub scenarios, say so and exit.
