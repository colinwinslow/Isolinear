# HANDOFF.md

## Current project phase

Seed phase. The repo is being prepared with ADRs, specs, BDD scenarios, schemas, eval outlines, and Codex working rules before production implementation.

## Product summary

Isolinear lets a user ask natural-language questions about approved Home Assistant entities and receive generated data visualizations based on entity history.

## Current architecture direction

- Home Assistant custom integration.
- TypeScript Lit custom dashboard card as the first UI (`custom:isolinear-card`).
- Optional Home Assistant add-on worker for rendering and sandbox execution.
- Standalone worker mode should remain possible for Home Assistant installs that cannot use add-ons.
- Model provider should be Ollama-compatible, with local-first defaults and optional stronger providers later.
- Trusted chart-spec renderer is the default path.
- Sandboxed matplotlib codegen is an advanced path.

## Open implementation status

Fake-provider vertical slice implemented as a local Python module with schema-backed contract validation, a pre-render plan validation gate, deterministic render metadata validation, trusted safe-mode rendering for shaded interval overlays, state interval timelines, and aggregate bar charts, fake binary-state interval extraction, confirmed threshold-derived interval extraction, deterministic threshold clarification for continuous power sensors, use-once threshold confirmation handling, deterministic threshold semantic alias creation, reuse of saved threshold aliases, deterministic invalidation of saved threshold aliases that reference unavailable or non-allowlisted entities, and a versioned semantic-memory store envelope anchor that computes invalidity at use time while failing closed for unsupported versions or duplicate alias IDs. Eval scripts now emit structured `CASE` evidence payloads, and implemented eval-backed scenario groups have paired markdown BDD/evidence files under `bdd/<feature>/`.

Dashboard card implementation technology is decided in ADR-0011: the MVP card is a TypeScript Lit custom element loaded as `custom:isolinear-card`, bundled as an ES module, and kept as a thin client over integration-owned Home Assistant WebSocket commands. The card must not directly call the worker, model provider, Home Assistant history APIs, semantic-memory storage, mutation services, or browser local storage for Isolinear state.

Dashboard card anchor implementation is complete. The repo now has a
Node-backed frontend anchor under `frontend/` with TypeScript Lit source, a
checked-in Vite ES module bundle, fake Home Assistant harness, fixture job
snapshots, Vitest adapter coverage, Python verifier/eval coverage, and raw
BDD evidence proving idle, planning, clarification, complete, failed, and
integration-boundary scenarios. Repo-local setup scripts create `.venv`, run
pytest, resolve the Windows Node.js install, and run frontend install/build/test
commands without depending on ambient PATH.

Worker API transport and authentication is designed and anchored in ADR-0012.
The card-facing API is a versioned Home Assistant WebSocket command set under
`isolinear/v1/` for job start, clarification answer, retry, snapshot retrieval,
and subscription. The worker-facing render API is a versioned HTTP JSON
envelope for `POST /v1/render` authenticated with an integration-owned bearer
token that is never sent to the dashboard card or model provider. The repo has
schemas, a Python verifier, tests, eval evidence, and frontend adapter coverage
for the command/envelope contract, bad-auth and bad-version rejection, and token
redaction.

Sandbox implementation for Raspberry Pi compatibility is anchored. The worker
sandbox spec now defines the concrete codegen strategy: schema validation before
execution, static AST safety checks, isolated Python subprocess execution with
`-I`, stripped environment, fixed `render_chart(data, output_path)` entry point,
runtime audit hook, fixed output-path writes, subprocess timeout, Linux
`resource` CPU/address-space requests where available, and max output image
size enforcement. The repo has a `CodegenSandboxPolicy` schema, Python anchor,
focused tests, executable eval, and paired BDD/evidence proving safe fixed-entry
execution, exact generated-code import allowlisting, allowlisted matplotlib
`Agg` rendering, forbidden import/file/environment/network rejection before
execution, runtime audit denial for arbitrary reads routed through
`pyplot.imread`, oversized output failure, and capped repair-loop behavior with
static checks rerun on every attempt. The dev environment now installs
matplotlib through `requirements-dev.txt`; production worker packaging remains
responsible for providing matplotlib in the isolated worker image.

First trusted renderer release scope is anchored. The chart-spec rendering spec
now defines the safe-mode trusted scope as `time_series` charts with numeric
`line` series, entity-backed sources, no transform except `none`, optional
`shaded_intervals` overlays from supplied `DerivedInterval` records, PNG output,
and no fallback into codegen. The Python trusted-renderer anchor validates
render contracts, fails unsupported schema-valid primitives with structured
`unsupported_chart_spec` details before writing output artifacts, and reports
zero codegen attempts. The renderer BDD/evidence and
`evals/trusted_renderer_primitives.py` prove supported line/overlay rendering
and unsupported primitive rejection. The spec records six follow-up trusted
renderer families: state interval timeline, aggregate bar, calendar/hour
heatmap, event markers, distribution/histogram, and scatter/correlation.
Floorplan heatmaps are deferred until post-MVP because Home Assistant floors
and areas do not provide room geometry; they will require explicit
user-provided geometry and area/entity mappings.

Trusted renderer state interval timeline follow-up is anchored. The chart-spec
rendering spec now selects `state_interval_timeline` as the first follow-up
family and defines safe-mode `timeline` charts with binary/categorical `step`
tracks, entity-backed sources, no transform except `none`, one matching
`DerivedInterval` per track, absolute time-range metadata, PNG output, and no
codegen fallback. The Python anchor uses chart-family-specific unsupported
checks so `time_series` remains limited to numeric `line` series while
`timeline` requires state-like history and matching derived intervals. Timeline
rendering fails closed before artifact creation if the derived interval source
entity does not match the chart series source. The BDD/evidence and
`evals/state_interval_timeline.py` prove timeline rendering, deterministic
metadata, validation, and zero codegen attempts.

Trusted renderer aggregate bar chart follow-up is anchored. The chart-spec
rendering spec now defines the `aggregate_bar_chart` family as safe-mode
`bar` charts with aggregate numeric series, `source.type: aggregate`, one bar
per source entity, `mean`/`min`/`max`/`sum`/`count` operations, no transform
except `none`, no overlays, PNG output, and no codegen fallback. The Python
anchor adds bar-family primitive checks so time-series and timelines remain
entity-backed while bars require aggregate sources. Aggregate rendering
computes values from matching numeric `HistorySeries` records over the chart
time range, emits deterministic x-range metadata, and fails closed before
artifact creation if any aggregate source history is missing or has no numeric
points. The BDD/evidence and `evals/aggregate_bar_chart.py` prove rendering,
metadata, validation, and zero codegen attempts.

No Home Assistant integration has been built yet.

## Next recommended packet

Trusted renderer calendar/hour heatmap follow-up:

1. Define the calendar/hour heatmap primitive contract in the chart-spec
   rendering spec.
2. Scaffold or extend the paired BDD/evidence and eval outline for heatmap
   rendering.
3. Add focused schema/anchor/eval coverage proving the new primitive renders
   from validated `ChartSpec` without falling into codegen mode.

## Known unresolved design details

- Semantic-memory storage-helper implementation, migrations, and repair UI details beyond the envelope contract.
- Worker token rotation UI, worker health/readiness endpoint, and long-running
  progress streaming semantics.
- Production worker packaging details for matplotlib and target Home Assistant/Raspberry Pi images.
- Exact primitive contract for each trusted renderer follow-up family.
- Post-MVP floorplan heatmap geometry, upload/storage, and room-mapping contract.
- Exact dashboard resource auto-registration behavior once the integration
  scaffold exists.
